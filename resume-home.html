				To make it easier to read and navigate I have broken up my resume into several pages accessible through the
				nav bar to your left. The education page is pretty self explanatory, it consists of a detailed list of all
				my educational experience. The work experience page features a table of the jobs I have had, and a short
				summary of what my duties were.

				As far back as I can remember I have always been interested in math and science. I wasn't the most motivated
				when it came to school in my younger years but I always gravitated towards those subjects. Throughout elementary school
				to high school anytime we had a substitute teacher in a science class most of the time that meant an educational
				video. Most of the kids in my class would take a nap or doodle but I would be on the edge of my seat.
