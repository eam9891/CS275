            <p>
                Currently my job is self employed carpentry. I mainly do residential remodeling including additions, windows,
                doors, interior and exterior trim, small cabinetry and shelving, and siding. Through this job I have learned many
                skills and gained a lot of insight into running a business. Patience and planning as the job is always changing
                and staying prepared is key if you want to be on budget.
