                My first encounter with any type of programming was when I took an introductory class at Manchester Community College.
                Using C++ we learned the basics of variables, input and output, functions, loops, and arrays. It was a long time ago
                and the only thing I really took away from that class were the basic principles.
                I took that a step further over winter break of 2015-2016 and started writing a simple 2D game engine using OpenGL.
                Following a couple tutorial series on youtube I was able to get a few simple games working. It still amazeses me how
                unimaginably complex these programs are. The picture to the left shows one of the games I made while following the series.
                The engine is about 12 files with 100+ lines of code each, and the game so far is 6-7 files with 100+ lines of code.<br>

                Last semester I took the MWD-110 class here at Uhart and learned all about html and css. It was a very thorough class
                where we learned how to create responsive websites to fit any size screen. Over the summer I took that
                a step further and began learning php and mySQL on my own. I setup a home server on a small embedded computer as a development
                environment running linux. In my spare time I put together a reasonably secure login system with registration
                and started working on an admin page with some user management features. I am still actively working on this while learning
                how to build a CMS.
