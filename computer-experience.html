        <h3>Computer Experience</h3>
        <p>
            My experience with using computers starts back in the late 90's when my uncle gave us our first
            desktop computer, a pc running windows 95. It took about an hour to boot up and then another 20
            minutes to log in. We got a dial up internet connection shortly after and I can remember waiting
            all night long to download a single song. I mainly used it to listen to music, talk to friends
            on AIM, and play games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then I have used computers on a daily basis. My family went through several hand me down
            desktop pcs before I finally got my own computer around 2007, a macbook laptop. It was certainly
            a step up from what I was used to but it wasn't until I graduated high school in 2012 that I
            decided to build my first desktop. This is still my main pc today although it has had some upgrades since then.

                <p>
                    Over the summer of 2016 I decided to build a small home server for learning and development purposes.
                    I had no experience with servers in any sense, either hardware or software wise, and so I set off to
                    research from the ground up. After a few weeks of reading stack overflow and digital ocean posts
                    my criteria were established and I began shopping. I decided on the Banana Pro board, a knock off of the
                    popular Raspberry Pi. It is credit card sized, uses barely any power, has gigabit ethernet, and a sata port,
                    check out the full specs below.
