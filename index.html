            <h3> Introduction </h3>
            <p>
                My experience with using computers starts back in the late 90's when my uncle gave us our first desktop
                computer, a pc running windows 95. It took about an hour to boot up and then another 20 minutes to log in.
                I mainly used it to play games, chat with friends, and listen to music. We got a dial up internet connection shortly
                after and I can remember waiting all night long to download a single song. I mainly used it to listen to music,
                talk to friends on AIM, and play games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I have used computers on a daily basis. My family went through several hand me down desktop pcs
                before I finally got my own computer around 2005, a macbook laptop. It was certainly a step up from what I was used to
                but it wasn't until I graduated high school in 2012 that I decided to build my first desktop. This is still my main
                pc today although it has had some upgrades.

            <h3> Programming Experience </h3>
            <p>
                My first encounter with any type of programming was when I took an introductory class at Manchester Community College.
                Using C++ we learned the basics of variables, input and output, functions, loops, and arrays.
                I took that a step further over winter break of 2015-2016 and started writing a simple 2D game engine using OpenGL.
                I managed to get a few simple games working but am still lacking on the art aspect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last semester I took the MWD-110 class here at Uhart and learned all about html and css. It was a very thorough class
                where we learned how to create responsive websites to fit any size screen. Over the summer I took that
                a step further and began learning php and mySQL on my own. I setup a home server on a small embedded computer as a development
                environment running linux. In my spare time I put together a reasonably secure login system with registration
                and started working on an admin page with some user management features. Using the google maps api I was able to render a
                map with all currently active users.
