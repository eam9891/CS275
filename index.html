		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			Hello and Welcome, my name is Ethan Morris. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Hartford, CT.
			I have always enjoyed technology and computers in general but recently decided to pursue a career in the field.
			My quest to obtain a Bachelors Degree has spanned many disciplines from civil to audio engineering but recently
			my passion for computing has led me to a degree in Computer Engineering Technology. I am interested in a great many things
			and this site is meant to be a collection of my works, interests, and hobbies.
